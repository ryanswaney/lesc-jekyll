  bio_text: |-
    Dick leads the Land Programs science team in The Nature Conservancy’s California Chapter. His work is focused on creating the tools and evidence to integrate conservation into land use and climate policies. Across a variety of California landscapes, his research assesses opportunities to align land conservation and other societal goals, such as alternative energy development, transportation infrastructure, food production and climate stabilization. Currently his priorities are focused on two climate-related conservation questions: how can ecological land management contribute to climate mitigation goals, and how to design connected networks of land that will help species adapt to climate change?

    Before the Conservancy, Dick worked for GreenInfo Network, where he specialized in helping organizations and public agencies design and communicate strategic priorities. His academic background is in geography with a B.A. from Middlebury College and an M.A. from University of Colorado.

- name: Dr. Grace Wu
  title: Smith Conservation Fellow, UC Davis
  bio_text: |-
    I am currently a UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Davis in the CSTARS lab working with Dr. Susan Ustin.


    I am an environmental scientist studying land use for energy and conservation needs. My research seeks to understand the impact of energy infrastructure on land use and conservation, and to develop practical strategies for avoiding negative impacts. I am broadly interested in the dynamics and drivers of land use change, land use policy, and advancing our ability to plan for sustainable, multi-use landscapes that protect biological diversity. As the study of land use is deeply interdisciplinary, I combine methods from landscape ecology, energy economics and engineering, remote sensing, and spatial science in my research. Through collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, I have developed a spatial model to understand land-use constraints in meeting ambitious renewable energy targets in California, which led to regulatory improvements that simultaneously advance conservation and climate goals. I co-founded the Multi-criteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) initiative, which seeks to enable and improve the planning of low-carbon, cost-effective, socially and environmentally responsible energy systems through the development of decision support tools. Previously, I worked at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Notre Dame leading a project to understand climate change impacts on an endangered butterfly in the Great Lakes region. I graduated with a BA in Biology from Pomona College, a MPhil in Evolutionary Biology from University of Cambridge, and an MS and PhD in Energy and Resources from UC Berkeley.

    (IIASA)
  bio_text: |-
    Petr Havlik joined the Forestry Program as a Research Scholar in July 2007.

    After studies in the Czech Republic and in France, Dr. Havlik received an M.Sc. degree in economics and management (2001), and in economics of agriculture, agri-business, and rural development (2002), from the Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno (Czech Republic) and the University of Montpellier 1 (France), respectively. In his master's thesis he analyzed positive environmental externalities arising from agriculture, first from the demand side, applying monetary valuation methods to agricultural landscapes, and then from the supply side, evaluating the production cost of these externalities by means of mathematical programming farm-level models.

    Dr. Havlik pursued the analysis of environmental goods production by farmers also in his PhD thesis, under a double supervision at the University of Montpellier 1 and the Mendel University. Within his PhD thesis, he explicitly considered the jointness in production of environmental and agricultural goods, and the jointness between environmental goods themselves. By means of mathematical programming models, he analyzed implications of jointness for agri-environmental policy design, with special attention to uncertainty. He defended his thesis and received a PhD degree in 2006.

    Before joining IIASA, Dr. Havlik shortly worked as a post-doc at INRA Grignon (France), where he set up a spatially explicit optimization model for the design of biodiversity compatible landscape pattern policies. Dr. Havlik's current research interests include the use and development of forest and agricultural sector optimization models at the European and global level.

The **Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation** event is a special edition of the Low-Emissions Solutions Conference taking place alongside the Global Climate Action Summit in partnership with the University of California Berkeley Lab and University of San Francisco in addition to other local partners. The event is brought to you with support from Enel.

The **2018 Global Climate Action Summit** will bring together leaders from state and local governments and business from around the world. In an official GCAS affiliate side-event, LESC will host panels featuring distinguished speakers who will highlight the current state of technological solutions in each field and identify research, funding, and policy gaps. The agenda will include facilitated networking sessions to promote multi-stakeholder collaboration.

This year’s LESC features distinguished panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who will address the themes of energy and land use. It will begin with a plenary session on **The Land-Energy Nexus In Climate Change Mitigation**, a conversation about the role of energy in low-carbon land-use scenarios and land use in low-carbon energy scenarios. The plenary aims to challenge assumptions that could lead to unworkable approaches to decarbonization, and develop frameworks for land-energy integration that are conceptually sound and implementable on the ground.

The plenary will be followed by concurrent sessions on **Decarbonizing Energy and Land Use** that will dig deeper into these topics and the latest breakthroughs and challenges in technology and policy. The agenda will also include opportunities for poster sessions, information stations, and facilitated networking to promote collaboration.
