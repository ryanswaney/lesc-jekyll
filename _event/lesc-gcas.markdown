The 2018 Summit will bring together leaders from state and local governments and business from around the world. In an official GCAS affiliate side-event, LESC will host panels featuring distinguished speakers who will highlight the current state of technological solutions in each field and identify research, funding, and policy gaps. The agenda will include facilitated networking sessions to promote multi-stakeholder collaboration.  


The thematic focus of the panel sessions will be land-use pathways and energy pathways to deep decarbonization.
