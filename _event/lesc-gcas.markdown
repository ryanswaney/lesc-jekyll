  description: To achieve the goals of the Paris agreement and keep global warming
    to well below 2 ℃ emissions from energy and land-use change must be reduced rapidly
    and carbon dioxide will need to be removed from the atmosphere to achieve zero
    net emissions by mid-century globally. Many models for decarbonizing the energy
    system rely heavily on bioenergy for transportation fuel, dispatchable power and
    carbon removal. At the same time it will be essential to preserve and restore
    forests as a natural climate solution and to protect biodiversity. Meanwhile food
    production must increase to feed the world’s growing and increasingly affluent
    population. How do we achieve these daunting and essential goals simultaneously?

    both energy systems and land use.  Yet this transformation could also bring potential
    conflicts.  How can bioenergy production, siting of energy facilities like wind
    farms, and carbon sequestration in forests and soils be conducted so as to avoid
    impacts on food, water, and biodiversity?  \nThis panel will look at different
    frameworks and implementation mechanisms to avoid these conflicts, enhance the
    co-benefits of carbon-smart land use, and align stakeholder interests with the
    most sustainable pathways. Resource managers, decision makers, and policy advisors
    have a responsibility to fairly and sustainably manage our natural resources.

    After studies in the Czech Republic and in France, Dr. Havlik received an M.Sc. degree in economics and management (2001), and in economics of agriculture, agri-business, and rural development (2002), from the Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno (Czech Republic) and the University of Montpellier 1 (France), respectively. In his master's thesis he analyzed positive environmental externalities arising from agriculture, first from the demand side, applying monetary valuation methods to agricultural landscapes, and then from the supply side, evaluating the production cost of these externalities by means of mathematical programming farm-level models.

    Dr. Havlik pursued the analysis of environmental goods production by farmers also in his PhD thesis, under a double supervision at the University of Montpellier 1 and the Mendel University. Within his PhD thesis, he explicitly considered the jointness in production of environmental and agricultural goods, and the jointness between environmental goods themselves. By means of mathematical programming models, he analyzed implications of jointness for agri-environmental policy design, with special attention to uncertainty. He defended his thesis and received a PhD degree in 2006.

    Before joining IIASA, Dr. Havlik shortly worked as a post-doc at INRA Grignon (France), where he set up a spatially explicit optimization model for the design of biodiversity compatible landscape pattern policies. Dr. Havlik's current research interests include the use and development of forest and agricultural sector optimization models at the European and global level.

Most recently his major focus has been on advising California’s regulators and stakeholders on the most effective ways to implement the state’s clean energy and greenhouse gas mitigation policies.

    Ren began his career by demonstrating the potential of deploying distributed energy resources to defer infrastructure investments, saving costs and enabling the integration of renewables into the grid. During the restructuring era of the 1990s, he devised a rate-making mechanism that enabled Texas utilities to recover stranded costs while giving retail customers access to wholesale market prices. He also supported the opening of transmission markets by developing FERC-compliant tariffs for Canadian utilities and assisting the California ISO in developing tariffs and evaluation processes for transmission projects.

    Ren is a longtime advisor to policy makers and executives in every corner of the electricity arena: government agencies, utilities, system operators, regulators, independent power producers, energy technology companies, public interest organizations, and investors. He has also published his work widely in top scholarly journals and served as an expert witness on numerous occasions.

    Even after 25-plus years of analyzing the industry, Ren still finds the electricity sector fascinating. He’s particularly excited by the accelerating pace of change, which technological innovation and public policy are driving. He enjoys applying E3’s deep analytic models and years of experience to new challenges and new markets.

  title: Smith Conservation Fellow, UC Davis
  bio_text: |-
    I am currently a UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Davis in the CSTARS lab working with Dr. Susan Ustin.

    I am an environmental scientist studying land use for energy and conservation needs. My research seeks to understand the impact of energy infrastructure on land use and conservation, and to develop practical strategies for avoiding negative impacts. I am broadly interested in the dynamics and drivers of land use change, land use policy, and advancing our ability to plan for sustainable, multi-use landscapes that protect biological diversity. As the study of land use is deeply interdisciplinary, I combine methods from landscape ecology, energy economics and engineering, remote sensing, and spatial science in my research. Through collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, I have developed a spatial model to understand land-use constraints in meeting ambitious renewable energy targets in California, which led to regulatory improvements that simultaneously advance conservation and climate goals. I co-founded the Multi-criteria Analysis for Planning Renewable Energy (MapRE) initiative, which seeks to enable and improve the planning of low-carbon, cost-effective, socially and environmentally responsible energy systems through the development of decision support tools. Previously, I worked at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and University of Notre Dame leading a project to understand climate change impacts on an endangered butterfly in the Great Lakes region. I graduated with a BA in Biology from Pomona College, a MPhil in Evolutionary Biology from University of Cambridge, and an MS and PhD in Energy and Resources from UC Berkeley.

The **Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation** event is a special edition of the **Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC)** taking place alongside the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley Lab and the University of San Francisco in addition to other local partners. The event is brought to you with support from Enel.

The **2018 Global Climate Action Summit** will bring together leaders from state and local governments and business from around the world. In an official GCAS affiliate side-event, LESC will host panels featuring distinguished speakers who will highlight the current state of technological solutions in each field and identify research, funding, and policy gaps. The agenda will include facilitated networking sessions to promote multi-stakeholder collaboration.

This year’s LESC features distinguished panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who will address the themes of energy and land use. It will begin with a plenary session on The **Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation,** a conversation about the role of energy in low-carbon land-use scenarios and land use in low-carbon energy scenarios. The plenary aims to challenge assumptions that could lead to unworkable approaches to decarbonization, and develop frameworks for land-energy integration that are conceptually sound and implementable on the ground.

The plenary will be followed by three concurrent sessions in two breakout rooms on **Decarbonizing Energy and Land Use** that will dig deeper into these topics and the latest breakthroughs and challenges in technology and policy. The agenda will also include opportunities for poster sessions, information stations, and facilitated networking to promote collaboration.

## Call for Abstracts

The event will feature a poster session and pop-up discussion showing off exciting new research to help build a carbon-neutral future. We invite all researchers helping to build the future in land- and energy-based climate change mitigation to [submit an abstract.](/2018/08/30/lesc-gcas-call-for-abstracts)
