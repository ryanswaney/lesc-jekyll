The **Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation** event is a special edition of the Low-Emissions Solutions Conference taking place alongside the Global Climate Action Summit in partnership the the University of California Berkeley Lab and the University of San Francisco in addition to other local partners. The event is brought to you with support from Enel.

The **2018 Global Climate Action Summit** will bring together leaders from state and local governments and business from around the world. In an official GCAS affiliate side-event, LESC will host panels featuring distinguished speakers who will highlight the current state of technological solutions in each field and identify research, funding, and policy gaps. The agenda will include facilitated networking sessions to promote multi-stakeholder collaboration.

This year’s LESC features distinguished panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who will address the themes of energy and land use. It will begin with a plenary session on **The Land-Energy Nexus In Climate Change Mitigation**, a conversation about the role of energy in low-carbon land-use scenarios and land use in low-carbon energy scenarios. The plenary aims to challenge assumptions that could lead to unworkable approaches to decarbonization, and develop frameworks for land-energy integration that are conceptually sound and implementable on the ground.

The plenary will be followed by concurrent sessions on **Decarbonizing Energy and Land Use** that will dig deeper into these topics and the latest breakthroughs and challenges in technology and policy. The agenda will also include opportunities for poster sessions, information stations, and facilitated networking to promote collaboration.
