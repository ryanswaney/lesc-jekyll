    Three so-called “fire-starters” will be asked to stand and give very brief remarks for group input and discussion. Then all participants are welcome to input their thoughts and ideas as they are called upon by the moderator to add to the dialogue. Each speaker will be asked to stand up where they are seated, introduce themselves and contribute with an insight, remark, question or suggestion.

    This first dialogue will focus on need for stronger collaboration and increased climate action by public and private sector.

    At the same time, the current emissions gap also makes it clear that we need to be investing in new innovations to supplement what is possible using existing solutions.

    The climate change challenge requires a significant scale up in efforts across deploying existing and developing new solutions. We encourage a dialogue on practical next steps to ensure innovative solutions are implemented on the ground, in a spirit of collaboration.

- title: 'Ice-Breaker Dialogue-2: Scaling Up Natural Climate Solutions'
  date: 2018-12-11 20:25:00 Z
  description: "The significant potential of natural climate solutions (NCS) can only
    be fully realized with ambitious policy and business as a core implementation
    partner.\n\nNationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) mention only a handful
    of natural climate solutions, such as reforestation or forest protection. A majority
    of countries included land use in their NDCs, however, only 38 countries out of
    160 NDCs include specific targets on land use. According to the UNFCCC NAZCA database
    of subnational commitments on climate action, just 2% concern the land sector.
    \ The land sector receives just 2.5% of total public finance for climate mitigation.\n
    \nThis second dialogue will focus on how we can scale up natural climate solutions.
    We will explore how governments can create the enabling policies that support
    companies to deliver impactful climate action, faster. We will also identify the
    ways in which academia can support climate action with policy and business relevant
    research and raising awareness."
