This year’s International Conference on Sustainable Development will be the most important and historic yet! Not only will the science and policy be at the cutting edge; the conference will take place on multiple campuses around the world, making it a truly global event. ICSD will host students from around the world, top scientists, and world leaders from politics to government to the UN. I urge everybody interested in sustainable development – the great challenge of our age – to come to ICSD. Alas, space is limited, but we’ll pack in all that we can!

ICSD brings together professionals from the private sector, academia, government, and civil society, along with students from the world’s top universities. We welcome participants from all sectors and experience levels. Simply register and help us reach our target of 1,000!

The LESC panel at ICSD will take place in the afternoon of day two. The panel will feature high-level speakers who will present key outcomes from the LESC-GCAS event which is taking place at the Global Climate Action Summit in California just two weeks before ICSD.
