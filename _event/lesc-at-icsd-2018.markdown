  description: The Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation, is a conversation
    about the role of energy in low-carbon land use scenarios and land use in low-carbon
    energy scenarios. This session aims to challenge assumptions that could lead to
    unworkable approaches to decarbonization, and discuss frameworks for land-energy
    integration that are conceptually sound and implementable on the ground. The panel
    will present solutions that their organizations have identified to help the world
    transition to a carbon neutral future.

This year’s __International Conference on Sustainable Development__ will be the most important and historic yet! Not only will the science and policy be at the cutting edge; the conference will take place on multiple campuses around the world, making it a truly global event. ICSD will host students from around the world, top scientists, and world leaders from politics to government to the UN.

ICSD brings together professionals from the private sector, academia, government, and civil society, along with students from the world’s top universities. We welcome participants from all sectors and experience levels.

The LESC panel at ICSD will take place in the afternoon of day two. The panel will feature high-level speakers who will present key outcomes from the LESC-GCAS event which is taking place at the __Global Climate Action Summit in California__ just two weeks before ICSD.
