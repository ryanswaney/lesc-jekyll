blurb: LESC now returns to COP, creating a space for in-depth dialogue with policy-makers.
  We recognize the scale of the challenge in implementing ambitious NDCs, but also
  the need to take action at the city, local, and project level. As such, the theme
  of this LESC is “Accelerating Action”. We will bring together global leaders who
  are taking bold action.

This year’s LESC features distinguished panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who will address the themes of energy and land use. Spotlight presentations will facilitate rich dialogue on what is still needed and how public-private partnerships can support the common objectives between nations, cities, business, and academia. The outcomes of this event will be submitted to the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. 

More details are coming soon.
