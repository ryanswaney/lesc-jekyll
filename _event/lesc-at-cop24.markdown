blurb: LESC now returns to COP, creating a space for in-depth dialogue with policy-makers.
  We recognize the scale of the challenge in implementing ambitious NDCs, but also
  the need to take action at the city, local, and project level. As such, the theme
  of this LESC is “Accelerating Action”. We will bring together global leaders who
  are taking bold action.

  description: The decarbonization of the power sector will be a crucial enabler to
    the transition to low-carbon transport, buildings, and industry sectors via the
    increasing electrification of energy-end uses. The primary levers to decarbonizing
    the power sector are phasing out unabated fossil fuel-based generation and expanding
    zero-carbon generation. Scaling up of renewable-based electricity (RE) is critical,
    and the share of generation from variable renewable technologies in particular
    - solar and wind -  must grow rapidly.

  description: "Electrification of passenger mobility via the increasing deployment
    of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) will play an important role in reducing CO2
    emissions from the transport sector. In addition to decarbonization targets, the
    electrification of passenger mobility in urban settings is driven by air quality
    concerns. The number of battery electric vehicles on the road have grown rapidly
    in 2018. The rapid growth in BEVs can be attributed to a large fall in battery
    prices combined with purchase incentives from governments. In addition, battery
    capacity improvements and infrastructure developments have also reduced range
    anxiety in drivers.\n \nWith growth in BEVs, smart charging will be necessary
    to manage the impact of BEVs on the power system, while also enabling them to
    play a complementary role in the energy transition by providing flexibility services
    to the grid. Through smart charging,  the timing of BEV charging can be optimized
    to ensure a reasonable balance between power supply and demand, which reduces
    the need for additional generation capacity, increases the grid asset use factor
    and reduces the curtailment of renewable generation. Demand-side management via
    smart charging can be facilitated by dynamic tariffs such as time-of-use or real-time
    pricing, which will incentivize consumers to charge BEVs when prices are low.
    Furthermore, BEVs represent storage capacity that could be used to provide ancillary
    services to the power grid via vehicle-to-grid (V2G) solutions."

  description: "In the long-term, all buildings must be net zero-emissions buildings;
    the technologies needed to achieve this goal are available today. One of the key
    levers to decarbonizing the buildings sector is the electrification of space and
    water heating, which currently account for the majority of direct CO2 emissions
    from the sector. Electricity demand from the buildings sector will grow as a result
    of increasing electrification rates, and economic and population growth. To minimize
    load on the grid, electric devices across all end uses must be highly energy efficient.\n
    \nThe digitalization of household devices is one way to drive efficiency improvements.
    For example, digitalization increases the opportunities for device optimization
    by increasing awareness of energy consumption in real-time; and smart thermostats
    can use machine learning to automatically adjust room temperature in response
    to occupant behavior and input such as weather forecasts. In addition to efficiency
    improvements, demand response in the buildings sector enabled by digitalization
    will be important to managing load on the electricity system."

- name: Bertrand Piccard
  bio_text: |-
    Born in Lausanne (Switzerland) and descendant of a dynasty of explorers and scientists, who have conquered the heights and the depths of our planet, Bertrand Piccard seems predestined to perpetuate one of the greatest family adventures of the 20th century. Psychiatrist, aeronaut and internationally renowned lecturer, president of the humanitarian foundation "Winds of Hope" and goodwill ambassador for the United Nations, he aspires to combine his family scientific heritage with his commitment to exploring the great adventure of life.

    "Adventure is a state of mind in the face of the unknown, a way of conceiving our existence as an experimental field, in which we have to develop our inner resources, climb up the path of our personal evolution and assimilate the ethical and moral values, which we need as our travel companions."

    Pioneer of hanggliding and microlight flying in Europe, European hang-glider acrobatics champion in 1985 and winner of the first transatlantic balloon race (Chrysler Challenge 1992), Bertrand Piccard is also the initiator of the Breitling Orbiter project. His success as pilot in command of the first non-stop round the world balloon flight in 1999 has pushed him to the front of the stage as a “savanturier” (scholar-adventurer, scientist-adventurer).

    Following this success, he was decorated with the Legion of Honour, the Olympic Order and the highest distinctions of the International Aeronautical Federation, the National Geographic Society and the Explorer's Club. Honorary professor and honorary doctor in science and letters, he also received the Grand Prix of l’Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques.

    Thanks to his experiences, he officially launches in 2003 the Solar Impulse project, to take on a new challenge: flying round the world in an airplane propelled uniquely by solar energy, without fuel or pollution, in order to promote the immense potential of renewable energies and their new technologies.

    Bertrand Piccard is married to Michèle and has three children.

This year’s LESC features distinguished panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who will address the themes of energy and land use. Spotlight presentations will facilitate rich dialogue on what is still needed and how public-private partnerships can support the common objectives between nations, cities, business, and academia. The outcomes of this event will be submitted to the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action.

The IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C highlights that limiting warming to 1.5°C remains possible, but only if we urgently and rapidly transform all systems at an unprecedented scale. Net CO2 emissions need to be zero in 2050. In pursuit of this target, the energy system must transition away from fossil fuels – currently responsible for over 80% of primary energy demand – toward increasing shares of zero-carbon energy sources in all sectors. Given the scale of the challenge, all low-carbon solutions will be needed in this transformation. This session will present the decarbonisation efforts already taking place in the power sector, and showcase how this can decarbonise the transport and buildings sector through electrification.

**Registration:** No registration is required. This event is open to all accredited attendees of COP24
