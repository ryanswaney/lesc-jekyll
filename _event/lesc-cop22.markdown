* Chart key technology pathways for decarbonized energy systems, based on public-private partnerships
* Create an intensive global dialogue among engineers and technology specialists on best practices and innovative solutions for a low-emissions future

**500 participants joined the conference, including:**

* Senior representatives from government with responsibility for the design, promotion and implementation of NDCs and LEDSs.
* Technical experts in related fields, world-leading scientists and engineers, high level research representatives from the business sector and guests from cities and regions around the globe.
