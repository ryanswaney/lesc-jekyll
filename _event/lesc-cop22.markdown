  ## Low Carbon Fuels
  4:00 – 5:00pm

  Sustainable liquid fuels are back in the spotlight, with innovations such as waste-to-fuel or power-to-liquids changing the landscape. Low-carbon fuels make up only 3% of current transport fuels, but this figure must grow to 10% by 2030 to satisfy economic growth and help keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius.

  This panel will describe the exciting progress made from lab to market and explain how these fuels can be an essential part of LEDs and fulfill strict sustainability criteria in a wide variety of national circumstances.

  ## Low-Carbon Freight & Shipping
  5:00 – 6:00pm

  Heavy goods transport requires a step change in order to accelerate the decarbonization of the sector. We must integrate ICT solutions, build smarter infrastructure, share data and assets, improve route optimization use and deploy new vehicle/vessel design paradigms.

  This panel will set a benchmark for the least emitting means of shipping (ie, boat vs truck vs plane), and will review challenges and solutions to decarbonizing freight on a global scale.

  ## Clean Energy: Leading the Transition
  9:15 - 10:30am

  The future of the global energy mix: as new technology developments drive down renewable costs, and new financial business models widen the diversity of energy market players and investors, decarbonization becomes more attractive and paves the way for increased levels of ambition in LEDs.

  This session will present the latest technological advances in clean energy, including innovative and renewable solutions that are being deployed on the ground; as well as exploring how countries and utilities are dealing with the intermittency of renewables.

  ## Smart Grids
  11:00am - 12:30pm

  Stable, reliable electricity is a key building block of social and economic development. Recent advances in micro-grid models and distributed energy resources have brought about a new age of thinking in the sector.

  Implementing smart grid technology will serve as the backdrop to envision how we generate and distribute energy differently in the new energy mix. Explore the challenges and opportunities around smart grid technology, including computerized grids, two-way digital communication, and how developing nations are making this work in their communities.

  ## Lunch Break
  12:30 - 1:30pm

  ## Industry Climate Action and CCUS
  1:30pm - 2:45

  The production of power, iron, steel, cement and chemicals alone are estimated to account for more than 40% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing these emissions is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in a carbon-constrained future. Hear about the approaches that different sectors are taking towards carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCU&S).

  ## Climate Smart Agriculture and Innovation
  2:45 - 4:15pm

  This session highlights the important role of agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the role that climate smart agriculture solutions can play in helping countries achieve their NDCs.

  This panel will discuss practical solutions for Climate Smart Agriculture as a response to challenges as diverse as deforestation, soil and nutrient management, food loss and waste, and the protection of smallholder farmers. Learn how CSA can be facilitated through enhanced monitoring, reporting and verifying tools.

# Introduction and Background

The first LESC was launched at COP22 and was the first large-scale technical-solutions conference organized for country delegations, placing innovative technological solutions at the core of the COP meeting.

**The specific objectives of the conference were to:**

* Strengthen the technical capacities of the 196 signatory governments of the UNFCCC to design and implement long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies
* Chart key technology pathways for decarbonized energy systems, based on public-private partnerships
* Create an intensive global dialogue among engineers and technology specialists on best practices and innovative solutions for a low-emissions future

**500 participants joined the conference, including:**

* Senior representatives from government with responsibility for the design, promotion and implementation of NDCs and LEDSs.
* Technical experts in related fields, world-leading scientists and engineers, high level research representatives from the business sector and guests from cities and regions around the globe.
