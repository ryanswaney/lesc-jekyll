That’s 12 gigatonnes, or 11 times the amount of CO2 saved by the EU in the past 25 years. Smart agriculture improves crop yields and reduces food waste; e-work can save up to 100 hours of travel yearly per person leading to 67% less travel emissions; smart metering in the home allows real-time energy monitoring, leading to energy savings; and in other sectors such as health management, education, lighting & appliances and building efficiency, ICT also has tremendous potential to help reduce emissions.
  Explore approaches that can maximize the integration and benefits of ICT across different sectors.
