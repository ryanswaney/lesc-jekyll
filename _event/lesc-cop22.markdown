    ### Download resources and presentations from the LESC at COP22 event.
    [Presentations & Resources: LESC at COP22](/2017/03/10/resources-from-lesc-cop22/)
---

# Introduction and Background

The first LESC was launched at COP22 and was the first large-scale technical-solutions conference organized for country delegations, placing innovative technological solutions at the core of the COP meeting.

**The specific objectives of the conference were to:**

* Strengthen the technical capacities of the 196 signatory governments of the UNFCCC to design and implement long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies
