Mr. Hyman is an internationally recognised member of the surfing community, having established two of the best known and most successful surfboard brands in the world: Nev Future Shapes and recently Firewire Surfboards. He turned his attention to the housing industry in 2009 with a vision to use recyclable materials to build low cost rapidly deployable homes. When Nev is not surfing, you'll find him talking to Prime Ministers, Housing Ministers, Finance Ministers, Education Ministers, Health Ministers, Ministers for Energy, Community Elders, Clan Leaders and the Heads of Pension Fund Institutions. He has a heart for the people, a global solution and the resolve to make a difference in this world.
