Stuart Hocking is the Deputy Chief Executive of South Australian Department of Treasury & Finance and is responsible for advice on State budget strategy and economic, social and regulatory policy issues. He previously held the role of Chief Economist in the South Australian Department of Premier and Cabinet, where he played a key role in development of the South Australian Governmentâ€™s Climate Change strategy which resulted in the announcement in 2015 of South Australia's world-leading ambitions in carbon emission reductions - notably for Adelaide to be the world's first Carbon Neutral City and for South Australia to have net zero emissions by 2050. These initiatives have been recognised globally for their ambition and credibility.
