Dr. Doug Kaufman has been with TransLoc since February 2012 when he began as the general manager of products and services. He became CEO in June 2014 and began retooling the company to take advantage of the growing storm in transit technology, as well as the company’s unique capabilities and technological advantages. Since then, the team has grown considerably, the customer-base has spiked, and the company has expanded its offering from one product to five—including the first-ever transit mobile app that integrates transit with ridesharing and simplifies multi-modal travel for all. Prior to joining TransLoc, Doug founded multiple companies including clearTXT, a leading provider of mobile communication for colleges and universities, and Spring Metrics, a conversion analytics and intelligence solution. Doug was also an early team-member at Blackboard where he developed and managed a 250+ discipline-specific online educational resource center.
