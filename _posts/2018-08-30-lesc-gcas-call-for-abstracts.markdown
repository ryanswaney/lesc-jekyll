The [2018 Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS)](http://globalclimateactionsummit.org/) will bring together leaders from state and local governments and businesses from around the world. In an official GCAS affiliate side event, the [Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC)](http://www.lowemissions.solutions/) is hosting its first installment of the year entitled, [The Land-Energy Nexus in Climate Change Mitigation.](http://lowemissions.solutions/event/lesc-gcas) The event will feature a poster session and pop-up discussion showing off exciting new research to help build a carbon-neutral future. We invite all researchers helping to build the future in land- and energy-based climate change mitigation to submit an abstract.

Along with the poster session, the event boasts panels featuring distinguished speakers to be held throughout the day and will include facilitated networking sessions to promote multi-stakeholder collaboration. Event panelists will come from government, academia, business, and civil society. It will begin with a plenary session about the role of energy in low-carbon land-use scenarios as well as land use in low-carbon energy scenarios. The plenary aims to challenge assumptions that could lead to unworkable approaches to decarbonization, and develop frameworks for land-energy integration that are conceptually sound and implementable on the ground.

The poster session will be a great opportunity to share your work, learn about others’, and network.  Select presenters will be invited to deliver an “elevator pitch” about their work to this influential audience. If you have questions, please contact session chair Jack Chang at [jack_chang@berkeley.edu.](mailto:jack_chang@berkeley.edu)

### We are especially interested in current research addressing these questions:

* What is the next generation of technologies and system integration for energy-based climate change mitigation?
* What role can land-based solutions such as carbon sinks play in climate change mitigation?
* What the opportunities and challenges in integrating land-and energy based solutions?

### Research topics might include (although not exhaustive):

* Carbon Capture and Sequestration/Storage (CCS)
* Biofuels
* Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS)
* Renewable Energy
* Batteries and Energy Storage
* Climate Policy
* Financing
* Forestry and Forest Conservation
* Nuclear Energy
* Electric Vehicles
* Negative Emission Technologies (NETs)
* Carbon-Negative Biofuels
* Low-Carbon Transport

Other low-emissions research topics are welcome.
