LESC returned to COP24, creating a space for in-depth dialogue with policy-makers. Two events were hosted over two days. The first event on Monday, December 10th, entitled “Accelerating Action to a Low-Carbon Future” featured distinguished guests panelists from government, academia, business, and civil society who addressed the themes of energy and land-use. The second event on Tuesday, December 11th, was a High-Level Dinner Dialogue aimed at promoting dialogue between business, government, and academia on the role of land-use and natural climate solutions (NCS) as an essential component of climate action and brought continuity from the LESC event at GCAS which focused on the Land-Energy Nexus.
