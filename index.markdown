The successful implementation of the Paris Agreement will depend on the deployment of Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDSs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). **Technological developments and innovative practices will be key** in this process.

The **Low-Emissions Solutions Conference (LESC)** is aimed at problem solving, brainstorming, and global co-creation to inform nations about the latest technology developments. It brings together technical experts and world-leading scientists, engineers and innovators from business, academia, and cities, to share knowledge, exchange information, identify bottlenecks, discuss best practices, and prioritize future research in order to set common technological trajectories for a decarbonized economy as well as the transformations necessary in each sector.

The key outcomes of the LESC will feed into the **Global Climate Action Agenda.**
