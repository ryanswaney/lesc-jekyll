The __Low-Emissions Solutions Conference__ is a direct follow-up to key commitments in the Paris agreement. In the agreement, every country is responsible for producing a __Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)__ for the period to 2030 as well as a __Low-Emission Development Strategy (LEDS)__ to 2050 (Article 4, paragraph 19). The Solutions Conference will assist nations in the technical preparations of their NDCs and LEDSs by bringing together technical experts, world-leading scientists and engineers, and sectors from business, academia, and civil society. The Solutions Conference will be aimed at __problem solving, brainstorming, and global co-creation,__ without the pressures of inter-governmental negotiations or formal agreements. The goal will be to __share knowledge, exchange information, identify bottlenecks, discuss best practices, and prioritize future research.__  

The LESC has taken place annually since 2016 and will continue into the future to help strengthen the technical capacity of Paris Agreement implementers worldwide.

## Conference Objectives:

The main idea of this conference is to __support a collaborative brainstorming and solutions-oriented mode__ to the Paris Agreement, with the following specific objectives:    

* Strengthen the technical capacities of the 196 signatory governments of the UNFCCC to design and implement long-term low greenhouse-gas emissions development strategies as called for in the Paris Agreement (NDCs and LEDSs)
* Chart key technology pathways for decarbonized energy systems, based on public-private partnerships
* Create an intensive global dialogue among engineers and technology specialists on innovative solutions for a low-emissions future
* Enhance global exchange and partnerships for technology solutions between governments, businesses, academia, and civil society organizations.

## Participants Include:
* Senior representatives from government with responsibility for the design, promotion and implementation of NDCs and LEDSs.
* Technical experts in related fields, world-leading scientists and engineers, high level research representatives from the business sector and guests from cities and regions around the globe.

The __key outcome__ of the Solutions Conference will feed into the __Global Climate Action Agenda.__
